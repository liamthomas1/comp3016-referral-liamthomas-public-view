# 2021-COMP3016-W2: Free Project

Please update this file and include the instructions and use this document for your report.

Make sure to work entirely using OpenGL4.X which you can check if your project relies on shader files and does not use fixed functions for rendering.

Ideally keep the setup Rendering toolchain to reduce the trial and error process of finding something new that works for you.

Work incrementally and be aware of the scale and scope of your project.



The project for the comp3016 referral will be something to do with light and 3d Models.
As the users will be able to control light using the console as a base line so they can set using time so 12pm the light will be at the middle etc.
The model itself will be using ply file type which are create in blender such as this model

This so I can set up a ply reader and make sure the user is load it correctly as well to check for anything else.
This is inspired by later project I did during comp3015 which I find control light is fun and you can do fun stuff with it.
The random generator. Will as well include as well for people who donâ€™t want to set up it up, but this is same idea I had last time so Please tell me this is allow or not.
Anyway, that is short idea I have for this project. 

Controls
Project will be random lights which be able to contorl with console to chose object of the person choice into world with 3 different object a bulid(which start work on before this project) a ball and a table.

how it will control first will be console but if i have time it will control in real time
so for the consloe it work by asking what time they want to include so 12:00pm the light will be at top or 6am the light is being to show up
real time will allow people just using the arrow key to go forward or back in time
also auto will just increase time and loop by it self 


The Project will have 3d Object create by Swen Gaudl such as the boat or the cube, object create by me are cityofnight.obj file 
The project has use the freeproject given by Swen Gaudl with new code create by me using // create by Liam for anything made by me also link to where i got the infomation from
The project is idea is from game night and day loops
